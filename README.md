## üìö Project Overview
### AdminSphere is an Android application developed using React Native, designed to serve as a comprehensive employee management tool.

With features like access control, activity logs, and a notice board, AdminSphere streamlines organizational processes and enhances communication.

## üîê Guarded Access Feature
- ### AdminSphere incorporates a robust security measure in the form of a secure lock feature. When activated, this feature restricts access to sensitive operations such as deleting admin accounts, posting notices, and creating new admin accounts. Only authorized users with the appropriate credentials can unlock the feature, ensuring that critical actions are performed securely and responsibly.
